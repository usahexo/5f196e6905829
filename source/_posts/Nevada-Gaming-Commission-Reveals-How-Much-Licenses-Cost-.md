#  Nevada Gaming Commission Reveals How Much Licenses Cost 

On Monday, the Nevada Gaming Commission released the list of license fees for all gambling activities in the state. 

The cost of a license for sports betting is $500,000. For online poker, the cost is $250,000. The cost of a license for horse racing is $10,000. And the cost of a license for casino games is $1,000,000. 

These fees apply to both new and existing businesses. And they are non-refundable. 

The Nevada Gaming Commission says these licenses are necessary to protect consumers and ensure the integrity of gaming in the state. 

Many people are unhappy with these high costs. They feel that they will keep small businesses from entering the market. And they will only benefit large casinos. 

Others argue that these costs are necessary to ensure that only qualified businesses operate in Nevada’s gambling industry. They say that this will help protect consumers and maintain the integrity of gaming in the state. 

What do you think? Do the License Fees imposed by Nevada Gaming Commission justify their reasons? Will it help or hurt Small Businesses?

#  New Jersey Casino Operators Pay Over $1 Million For Licenses 

New Jersey casino operators pay over $1 million for licenses in order to offer online gambling services within the state. The licenses were issued on October 31st and are valid for five years.

In order to qualify for a license, an applicant must be approved by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) and meet certain financial requirements. The DGE is responsible for reviewing the applications and deciding who will be awarded licenses.

So far, 11 companies have been approved for a license. These include Casino Holdings, Golden Nugget Atlantic City, Hard Rock Atlantic City, Tropicana Entertainment, and William Hill US.

In order to offer online gambling services in New Jersey, casino operators must partner with a licensed iGaming operator. These operators will provide the technology and infrastructure needed to run the games.

There are currently three licensed iGaming operators in New Jersey: Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa, Caesars Entertainment, and bet365. More than 20 other companies are awaiting approval from the DGE.

Online gambling has been available in New Jersey since November 2013. In that time, more than $2 billion has been wagered on games such as blackjack, roulette, and slots.

#  Pennsylvania Gaming Fee Structure Released, Costs Start At $5 Million 

Pennsylvania’s gaming fee structure was released recently, and the cost for a casino license is set at $5 million. That’s just the initial cost, too; annual fees will also be levied, with the amount set to be determined later.

This announcement comes as no surprise, as Pennsylvania has been working to expand its gaming industry for some time now. The state already has a number of casinos, but Governor Tom Wolf is looking to increase that number in order to generate more revenue for the state.

The $5 million licensing fee is just the beginning, though. Operators of casinos in Pennsylvania can expect to pay a number of other fees, including: 
- A 54% tax on slot machines
- A 34% tax on table games
- A $10 million license renewal fee 
- A $5 million Initial application fee 
- A $1 million per year regulatory assessment 
- A one time $200,000 contribution to the Commonwealth Host Community Fund 
- A one-time $100,000 fee payable to the Gaming Control Board 
That’s not all, either. Slot operators will also have to pay a 1% excise tax on their gross terminal income. This money goes towards property tax relief in local communities where casinos are located.

Governor Wolf believes that these fees will help to generate much needed revenue for Pennsylvania. He stated that “This new gaming fee structure will bring in an estimated $100 million annually to help us fund our schools and create jobs across the state. These funds are critical investments in Pennsylvania’s future and I am pleased that we are able to provide this additional revenue stream without raising taxes on hardworking Pennsylvanians.”

#  Ohiya Casino & Resort Pays Up To $1.5 Million In License Fees 

The Ohiya Casino and Resort has agreed to pay the state of Nebraska up to $1.5 million in license fees. The casino is also expected to pay an annual fee of $100,000.

Governor Pete Ricketts says the money from the casino will help fund statewide improvements. “This is a great day for the State of Nebraska as we continue our work to make our state a better place to live, work, and raise a family,” Ricketts said.

The Ohiya Casino and Resort is located near Niobrara and will offer slot machines, blackjack, and roulette. It is expected to create around 100 jobs.

“Today’s announcement means good jobs and economic opportunity for the people of Niobrara County and northeastern Nebraska,” said Senator John Stinner of Gering.

#  Delaware Announces It Will Charge Casinos $100,000 To Operate

On March 1, the state of Delaware announced it will be charging casinos $100,000 to operate in the state. This is part of a new effort by the state to increase revenue and help close its budget gap.

The decision was met with mixed reactions from the casino industry. Some casino operators praised the move, saying it would help level the playing field and create a more competitive market. Others criticized the decision, saying it would drive business out of Delaware and cost jobs.

Delaware's gambling industry has been in decline in recent years. In 2016, gambling revenue was down 10% compared to 2015. The state hopes that the new fee will help stem the tide and generate an additional $2 million in revenue.

The money collected from the fee will be used to fund programs that benefit Delaware residents, such as education and infrastructure projects.
