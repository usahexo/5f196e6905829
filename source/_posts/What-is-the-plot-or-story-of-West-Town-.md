#  What mechanics are used in West Town? 

West Town is a mob-based action RPG which heavily relies on mechanics to make the game more interesting. In this article, we will be discussing the different mechanics used in West Town and how they work.



The first and most important mechanic in West Town is the use of mobs. Mob behavior is randomized, meaning that each individual mob has its own set of actions that it can take. This makes every encounter with mobs unique, as no two mobs will ever behave the same way. 

In addition to mob behavior, the game also uses a day/night cycle. This mechanic adds an extra layer of difficulty to the game, as enemies are stronger at night. The day/night cycle also affects other aspects of the game, such as certain items becoming available for purchase only at night. 

The final mechanic we'll be discussing is item durability. Items in West Town gradually lose durability as they are used. Once an item's durability reaches zero, it breaks and can no longer be used. This mechanic forces players to be careful with their items, as they cannot simply rely on using the same item over and over again.

#  How did West Town come about? 

West Town, located on the west side of Chicago, Illinois, is a neighborhood that has undergone many changes since its establishment in the early 1800s. 

One of the first documented settlements in the area was a Potawatomi village known as Kishwaukee. The village was likely destroyed in 1832 during the Black Hawk War. 

In 1835, a man named James Fletcher arrived in the area and established a trading post near what is now Racine Avenue and Lake Street. Fletcher would later be responsible for naming the area “West Town” because it was located west of downtown Chicago. 

The first settlers in West Town were primarily Irish immigrants who arrived in the 1840s and 1850s. Many of these settlers were fleeing the potato famine in Ireland. The Irish immigrants were followed by German and Scandinavian immigrants in the 1860s and 1870s. 

West Town experienced significant population growth in the late 1800s and early 1900s. This growth was largely due to the development of industrial jobs in the area. By 1910, West Town’s population had grown to over 30,000 people. 

The majority of West Town’s housing stock was developed between 1870 and 1920. Most of this housing is composed of two- and three-flats, as well as small single-family homes. 

Many of West Town’s older buildings have been preserved due to the efforts of neighborhood preservationists. In 1973, West Town was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. 

Today, West Town is a vibrant community that is home to a diverse mix of residents and businesses.
