#  What are the odds paid out on a royal flush?

When playing poker, the odds of being dealt a royal flush - the best hand possible - are around 0.002%. This means that for every 1,000 hands you play, you will only be dealt a royal flush two times. So, if you are playing Texas Hold'em and are dealt two aces as your hole cards, the odds of hitting a royal flush on the turn or river are about 1 in 40,000.

#  What is the rake for a No Limit Hold'em table?

The rake is a commission that the casino takes from the pot in order to profit from the game. The rake is typically 5-10% of the pot, but can vary depending on the casino and the game being played. For a No Limit Holdem table, the rake is usually $0.05-$0.10 per pot.
