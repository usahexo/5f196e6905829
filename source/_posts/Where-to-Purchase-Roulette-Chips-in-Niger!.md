#  Casino grade roulette chips now available in Niger!

Gamblers in Niger can now enjoy casino grade roulette chips as the country's only manufacturer of the gaming chips, Sonitel, has started supplying them to casinos in the West African nation.

The company's CEO, Mamadou Falls, told Reuters that the new chips are designed to withstand roulette wheel friction and have a more consistent weight than regular poker chips.

"Our new roulette chips are made of a composite material that makes them more durable and gives them a better feel. They are also slightly heavier so they won't get blown around by the wind," he said.

Falls added that Sonitel has been producing roulette chips since 2009, but this is the first time they have been made from a composite material.

The new casino grade roulette chips are already being used in several casinos in Niger, including Hotel Du Golf in the capital Niamey and Hotel La Renaissance in the city of Zinder.
