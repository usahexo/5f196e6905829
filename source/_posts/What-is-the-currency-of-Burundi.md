# Who was Thomas Alva Edison?

Thomas Alva Edison was an American inventor and businessman who developed many devices that greatly influenced life around the world. He is best known for his invention of the light bulb.

Edison was born in 1847 in Milan, Ohio, to a father who was a shingle maker and a mother who was a schoolteacher. When he was seven, his family moved to Michigan. Edison's interest in inventing began early; he created a telegraph machine at the age of 12 and developed his first working electric light bulb when he was just 17.

In 1876, one of Edison's inventions – the phonograph – made him famous overnight. The phonograph could record and play back voices and sounds. Over the next few years, Edison continued to invent new products including an automatic vote recorder for polling stations and a type of electric meter that could be used to measure electricity usage.

In 1879, Edison opened his own research lab, where he continued to develop new products including the incandescent light bulb, which he patented in 1881. In 1882, Edison founded the Edison Electric Light Company, which produced and sold electric lamps and power systems.

Edison's inventions not only improved daily life but also helped to establish major industries such as electricity generation and distribution, telephony and motion pictures. He received 1,093 patents in total during his lifetime (more than any other person).

Edison died in 1931 at the age of 84. He is remembered today as one of America's most ingenious inventors whose work greatly improved the quality of life for people around the world.
