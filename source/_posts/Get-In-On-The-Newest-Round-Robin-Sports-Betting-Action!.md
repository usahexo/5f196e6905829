Do you like to watch sports and also gamble on them? If so, then you're going to love round robin sports betting. This is a new type of wagering that's becoming increasingly popular, and it allows you to bet on multiple games at the same time. Here's how it works:

You first select the games that you want to bet on, and then you create a group of teams that will compete against each other in those matchups.

If your team wins, you collect your winnings; if they lose, then you lose your bet.

You can win or lose a lot of money in a short amount of time, so it's important to carefully research your options before placing any bets. There are also some great online resources available that can help you make informed decisions.
