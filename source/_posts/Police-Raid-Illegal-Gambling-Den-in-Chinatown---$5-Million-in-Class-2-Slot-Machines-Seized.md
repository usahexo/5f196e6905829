#  Police Raid Illegal Gambling Den in Chinatown - $5 Million in Class 2 Slot Machines Seized

Thursday, February 1, 2018

Just before dawn this morning, a combined force of NYPD and State Police raided an illegal gambling den in Chinatown. The raid yielded $5 million in Class 2 slot machines, as well as a considerable amount of cash believed to be proceeds from the illegal gaming operation.

This is not the first time that authorities have cracked down on illegal gambling in Chinatown; similar raids were conducted back in 2014 and 2015. However, those previous operations pale in comparison to the size of today's takedown.

According to NYPD Deputy Inspector Dennis DeQuatro, "This was by far the largest gambling den we've ever raided in Chinatown - or anywhere else for that matter."

The suspected operators of the gambling den are currently being questioned by police, and it is expected that they will be charged with a variety of offenses including money laundering and racketeering.

#  Police Raid illegal Gambling Operation in North End - More Than $1 Million in Class 2 Slot Machines Confiscated

Boston police raided an illegal gambling operation in the North End Wednesday night, confiscating more than $1 million in class 2 slot machines.

The raid took place at a warehouse on Commercial Street, just blocks away from Faneuil Hall and the Financial District. Officers seized more than 150 machines, each of which can hold up to $2,500 in cash.

Police say they have been investigating the gambling ring for months and that it is led by Chinese organized crime groups. The raid comes as part of a larger crackdown on illegal gambling operations in the city. In March, Boston police seized nearly 200 slot machines from a gambling hall in Chinatown.

"This is a major victory for law enforcement and the people of Boston," said Police Commissioner William Evans in a statement. "These illegal gaming establishments prey on vulnerable individuals and create serious public safety issues. We will continue to work closely with our partners to shut these operations down and protect our communities."
