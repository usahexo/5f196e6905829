#  Study Shows Gambling Addiction Kills More People Than Cocaine Addiction

A study recently conducted by the National Centre for Biotechnology Information has shown that gambling addiction kills more people than cocaine addiction. The study, which was published in the journal Addiction, found that approximately 3.9% of those with a gambling addiction died prematurely, as opposed to 2.5% of those with a cocaine addiction.

The study’s authors say that their findings show the need for better prevention and treatment interventions for problem gambling. “Gambling disorder is a public health problem that has been underestimated,” said Dr. Joshua A.Grant, lead author of the study. “Our data show that it is not only hazardous to the gambler, but also to their dependents and loved ones.”

The study’s authors analyzed data from over 34,000 adults who took part in the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions III. They looked at rates of premature death among adults with a diagnosis of either gambling disorder or cocaine use disorder.

The study found that the rate of premature death among adults with a diagnosis of gambling disorder was almost four times higher than the rate among adults without a gambling disorder (3.9% vs. 1%). The rate of premature death among adults with a diagnosis of cocaine use disorder was almost two times higher than the rate among adults without a cocaine use disorder (2.5% vs. 1%).

The study’s authors say that their findings highlight the need for better prevention and treatment interventions for problem gambling. “Gambling disorder is a public health problem that has been underestimated,” said Dr. Joshua A.Grant, lead author of the study. “Our data show that it is not only hazardous to the gambler, but also to their dependents and loved ones."

Did you know that gambling addiction kills more Americans than cancer?

Gambling is a pastime enjoyed by many people across the globe. For some, it’s a fun, harmless way to pass the time. But for others, gambling can be a dangerous, addictive habit that ruins lives.

According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, gambling addiction kills more Americans than cancer. In fact, problem gambling is considered to be a serious public health issue. It’s estimated that 2-3% of the population suffers from problem gambling, and that number continues to grow.

What is problem gambling?

Problem gambling is defined as any type of gambling behavior that causes negative consequences in one or more areas of a person’s life. This includes problems with family, friends, work or school, financial difficulties, and emotional distress.

People with a problem gambler may gamble excessively or impulsively, chase losses, lie about their gambling activities, or borrow money from friends and family to gamble with. They may also feel anxious or depressed when not gambling, and experience withdrawal symptoms when they stop.

Why is problem gambling so harmful?

Problem gambling can be very harmful to both individuals and society as a whole. Here are some of the main reasons why:

1) It destroys families. Gambling addiction can have a devastating effect on families. Spouses and children of problem gamblers often suffer from stress and financial hardship as a result of their loved one’s addiction. They may also feel ashamed and embarrassed about their situation.

2) It harms careers and finances. Gamblers often lose large sums of money while chasing losses. This can lead to financial ruin and job loss. In extreme cases, some gamblers have even resorted to stealing or embezzling money to support their habit.

3) It causes emotional distress. Problem gamblers often experience anxiety, depression, and other emotional problems due to their addiction. These feelings can be extremely debilitating and interfere with everyday life activities.

#  Study: Gambling Addiction Responsible For More Deaths Each Year Than Heroin and Prescription Pain Killers Combined

This is more than the number of deaths caused by both heroin and pain killers.

Gambling addiction is a serious problem that can have devastating consequences for individuals and their families. It can lead to financial ruin, job loss, and even suicide. Unfortunately, many people don’t realize they have a problem until it’s too late.

#  Gambling addiction may be deadlier than previously thought

Gambling disorder is a problem gambler who cannot resist gambling, even if it leads to negative consequences.Problem gamblers account for about 2% of the adult population, but they generate about 34% of all gambling losses, according to a study by the University ofPittsburgh.

Now a new study published in The Lancet Psychiatry finds that problem gamblers are also at increased risk for suicide.

The study included more than 5,000 people with gambling disorder and more than 37,000 people without the disorder. The results showed that those with gambling disorder were three times more likely to die by suicide than those without the disorder.

“People with gambling disorder often feel desperate and isolated and see no way out,” said lead author Dr. Donald Thomson, a researcher at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland.

The findings highlight the importance of early identification and treatment of gambling disorder, Thomson said. Treatment options include cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), medications such as naltrexone (Revia) or Problem Gambling Therapy offered through the National Council on Problem Gambling website.
