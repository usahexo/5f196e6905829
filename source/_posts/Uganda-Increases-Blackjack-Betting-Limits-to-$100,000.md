The decision was made in order to "curb illegal gambling and attract more foreign investors,"according to board chairman John Patrick Wandera.

#  Uganda Plans to Raise Blackjack Betting Limits to $500,000

The Ugandan government is planning to raise the betting limit for blackjack from $100,000 to $500,000. The new limit will come into effect next week, and it is hoped that it will help to boost the country's tourism industry.

Blackjack is a popular card game that is played all over the world. It is typically played with between one and six decks of cards, and the aim of the game is to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible.

In Uganda, blackjack has become increasingly popular in recent years. Many people enjoy playing it for its mix of luck and strategy. The current betting limit of $100,000 has proved to be too low for some players, so the government has decided to raise it to $500,000.

This move has been welcomed by many people in Uganda. They believe that it will help to attract more tourists to the country and boost its economy. There are already several casinos in Uganda where people can play blackjack, and the new betting limit is sure to increase interest in these establishments.

#  Uganda May Raise Blackjack Betting Limits to $1,000,000

Uganda is considering increasing the betting limits for blackjack from $5,000 to $1,000,000 according to a new bill proposed in parliament.

The current limit has been in place since 2004, and officials feel that it may now be time to raise the stakes in order to keep up with modernization and growth in the country.

Under the proposed bill, only those over the age of 21 would be able to gamble at casinos, and players would only be able to bet a maximum of 5% of their net worth each hand.

This increase would put Uganda in line with other countries in the region such as Kenya, where the betting limit for blackjack is currently set at $2,000,000.

Opposition to the bill is already mounting, with some lawmakers arguing that the increased limits could lead to more gambling addiction and financial ruin for many citizens.

Others argue that the government should focus on creating more jobs and economic opportunities instead of gambling venues.

The proposed amendment to the Casino Gaming Act would also see the maximum number of cards that can be used in a single hand raised from six to eight.

The Finance Ministry said the proposed changes are aimed at boosting tourism and generating more revenue for the country.

According to the Finance Ministry, there are currently six casinos in operation in Uganda, which generated revenue of USh15.6 billion (approx. $4 million) in 2016.

#  Uganda Considers Increasing Blackjack Betting Limits to $10,000,000

The Ugandan government is considering increasing the betting limit for blackjack from $5,000,000 to $10,000,000.

The proposal was made by the Minister of Finance and Economic Planning, Matia Kasaija, during a question-and-answer session in Parliament.

Kasaija said that the increase in betting limits would help to generate more revenue for the government. He also argued that it would help to create more jobs in the country.

However, some members of Parliament voiced their opposition to the proposal. They argued that it could lead to an increase in gambling addiction and poverty.

Uganda's current betting limit for blackjack is one of the lowest in Africa. The highest betting limit is currently $100,000,000 in Zimbabwe.
