Playing pachinko can be a lot of fun, but it can also be lucrative if you know how to play the game properly. In this article, we will take a look at some winning strategies for Super Pachinko that can help you take home the jackpot!

One of the most important things to remember when playing Super Pachinko is to always aim for the middle row. This is where most of the balls will end up, and if you can hit a few in this row, you’re likely to end up with a big payout.

Another thing to keep in mind is that certain balls are worth more than others. The black balls, for example, are worth more than the white balls. So if you can aim for those balls specifically, you stand a better chance of winning big.

Finally, remember to keep your bet levels consistent. If you increase your bets too quickly, you could quickly lose all your money – and worse still, wind up in debt. Play smart and gradually increase your bets as you win more and more money – that way, you’ll stand a better chance of walking away with the jackpot!
