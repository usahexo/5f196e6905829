 <h2>Eric Molina: From the Poker Table to the NFL</h2>

<p>In 2006, Eric Molina was just an undrafted rookie out of LA Valley College trying to make it in the NFL. He had a tough road ahead of him, as he was competing against experienced veterans for a spot on the team. To make matters more difficult, Molina was also vying for a spot on the team as a tight end – a position that is often used as a backup player.</p>

<p>Undeterred by the odds, Molina worked hard during training camp and made an impressive showing. However, he was eventually cut from the team during final roster cuts. Devastated by his release, Molina returned home to California and began working odd jobs to support himself.</p>

<p>Fortunately for Molina, he was given another chance to play in the NFL when he was signed by the Houston Texans in 2007. He spent two seasons with the Texans before being released in 2009. Undaunted, Molina continued to work hard and improve his skills. In 2011, he was signed by the Pittsburgh Steelers and played in six games for them before being released.</p>

<p>Undefeated, Molina kept on fighting. In 2015, he was finally signed by the Dallas Cowboys and played in one game for them before being released again. However, this would not be the last time that Molina would be signed by an NFL team. In 2016, he signed with the Detroit Lions but was released after playing only one game.</p>

<p>Despite his many setbacks, Eric Molina never gave up on his dream of playing in the NFL. And now, after years of hard work and determination, he has finally achieved his goal. In 2017, Molina was signed by the Cleveland Browns and is currently playing as their starting defensive end.</p>

<p>It has been a long road for Eric Molina, but through hard work and perseverance he has achieved his dream of playing in the NFL. We can all learn from his example and never give up on our dreams no matter how difficult they may seem.</p>
