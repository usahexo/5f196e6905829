#  When Will Freie Und Hansestadt Hamburg Casino Reopen?

Freie Und Hansestadt Hamburg Casino, popularly known as Spielbank Hamburg, is one of the largest and most famous casinos in Germany. The casino is situated on the Grosse Elbstrasse in the city of Hamburg, right next to the Reeperbahn. The casino has been closed for renovation since September 1, 2017. The question on everyone's mind is when will it reopen?

There has been no official word from the casino management about when exactly it will reopen. However, there are speculations that it might open in December 2017. This is based on the fact that a lot of work needs to be done and there is not much time left before December.

The renovation work is being carried out by the company STC-Group which is based in Berlin. The company was awarded the contract to carry out the renovation work by the casino management in November 2016. The contract is said to be worth €10 million.

Some of the work that needs to be done includes: 
- Construction of a new entrance building 
- Redesign of all public areas 
- Extension of gaming area 
- Modernization of technical infrastructure 
- Creation of additional parking spaces 

According to STC-Group, the renovation work will take around 14 months to complete. This means that the casino might reopen in January or February 2018.

Some of the changes that are planned for the casino include new games, restaurants, and a bar. There will also be a new hotel built on the premises. The goal is to make the casino more attractive for tourists and to create more jobs for locals.

The casino in Hamburg, Freie und Hansestadt, is set to reopen in late 2019 after being closed for renovation. The new casino will have twice the number of gaming tables and slot machines as the old one and will also feature a restaurant and bar.

Hamburg is Germany’s second-largest city and is home to about 1.8 million people. The city is located on the Elbe River and is well known for its port, which is one of the busiest in Europe. The city also has a rich cultural history, with many museums, theaters, and music venues.

The casino in Hamburg was first opened in 1963 as the Spielbank Hamburg. It was later expanded and renamed the Casino Esplanade Hamburg. In 2016, the casino closed for renovation and was expected to reopen in 2018. However, due to construction delays, the reopening has been pushed back to late 2019.

The new casino will be housed in a new building that is being constructed next to the old casino. The new building will have four stories and a total of 350 gaming tables and 1,500 slot machines. The old building will be demolished once the new casino opens.

In addition to the gaming tables and slot machines, the new casino will also have a restaurant and bar on its premises. The restaurant will be called “Casino Zwei” and will serve Mediterranean cuisine. The bar will be called “Cocktail Bar” and will serve cocktails and light snacks.

The reopening of the Casino Esplanade Hamburg is sure to be a popular event among gamblers in Hamburg as well as tourists visiting the city. With twice as many gaming tables and slot machines as before, as well as a restaurant and bar on site, the new casino is sure to be a hit among gambling enthusiasts!
