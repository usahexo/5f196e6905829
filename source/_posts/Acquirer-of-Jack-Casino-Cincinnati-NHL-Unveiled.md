#  Acquirer of Jack Casino Cincinnati NHL Unveiled

The Jack Casino Cincinnati NHL has been bought by an unknown acquirer, according to recent reports.

The casino, which is one of the most popular in the state of Ohio, will now be under new ownership.

As yet, the identity of the new owner has not been revealed.

It is thought that the purchase price for the casino was in the region of $200 million.

This is not the first time that Jack Casino Cincinnati NHL has changed hands – it was sold to Rock Gaming LLC in 2013 for $60 million.

At this stage, it is unclear what plans the new owner may have for the casino.

#  Who Acquired Jack Casino Cincinnati NHL?

On Tuesday, February 5, 2019, it was announced that the Jack Casino Cincinnati had been acquired by the NHL. The NHL purchased the casino from its previous owner, Rock Gaming LLC, for an undisclosed amount.

The casino will now become the Official Casino of the NHL and will offer gaming experiences and content inspired by the league and its teams. In addition to traditional casino games, the Jack Casino Cincinnati will offer unique experiences such as virtual reality hockey games and viewing parties for major league hockey games.

This acquisition is another step in the NHL's strategy to grow its fan base and extend its reach into new markets. The Jack Casino Cincinnati is one of the largest casinos in Ohio, with over 2,000 slot machines and 55 table games. It is also one of the most popular tourist destinations in Cincinnati, drawing over 4 million visitors each year.

NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said of the acquisition: "We are excited to partner with Rock Gaming and bring our fans incredible experiences that showcase our sport and celebrate its players. This partnership builds on our goal of growing hockey's popularity in new markets across North America."

Rock Gaming CEO Matt Cullen added: "Our team is extremely proud of what we have built at JACK Cincinnati Casino. We are confident that under the NHL's ownership and management, JACK will continue to be a premier destination for gaming and entertainment in Ohio."

The acquisition is the latest in a series of moves by Blackstone to expand its presence in the North American gambling industry. The company has been on a buying spree in recent years, purchasing casinos in Nevada, New Jersey, and Ontario.

The Jack Casino Cincinnati is one of the largest in the region, with over 2,500 slot machines and 120 table games. The NHL team, which has yet to be named, will play its home games at the casino's $375 million arena.

"This is a very exciting day for our organization," said Concordia President and CEO, Sean O'Leary.

The Jack Casino Cincinnati NHL is a top-tier team in the NHL and is expected to compete for the Stanley Cup this season.
