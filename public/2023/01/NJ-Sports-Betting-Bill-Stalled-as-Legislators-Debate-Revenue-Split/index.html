<p>The bill, which was introduced last month, would allow casinos and racetracks to offer sports betting. The state would take a 9.75% cut of the gross revenue from bets, while the casinos and racetracks would keep the rest.</p>
<p>However, some legislators want to increase the state’s cut to 15%, saying that it is necessary to offset the cost of regulating the new industry. Other lawmakers are opposed to any increase in the state’s share of the revenue.</p>
<p>Governor Phil Murphy has said he supports increasing the state’s share to 15%, but it is not clear if there is enough support in the legislature to pass such a measure.</p>
<p>If passed, New Jersey would be the second state after Delaware to allow sports betting.</p>
<h1 id="NJ-Lawmakers-Remain-at-Odds-Over-Who-Gets-to-Benefit-from-Sports-Betting"><a href="#NJ-Lawmakers-Remain-at-Odds-Over-Who-Gets-to-Benefit-from-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="NJ Lawmakers Remain at Odds Over Who Gets to Benefit from Sports Betting"></a>NJ Lawmakers Remain at Odds Over Who Gets to Benefit from Sports Betting</h1><p>The state of New Jersey is still embroiled in a battle with professional sports leagues over who should benefit from legalized sports betting.</p>
<p>Last week, the US Supreme Court sided with the state, striking down a federal law that effectively prohibited sports betting in most states.</p>
<p>But now the question is who will get to profit from it?</p>
<p>Gov. Phil Murphy and other Democratic lawmakers want the cash to go directly to the state’s coffers, while the leagues want a piece of the action.</p>
<p>“The NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL all opposed New Jersey’s efforts to legalize sports betting,” Murphy said in a statement after the court’s ruling. “Now that they have lost in court, they are trying to rewrite the rules so they can get their cut of the action.”</p>
<p>In fact, Major League Baseball has already filed a federal lawsuit seeking a cut of New Jersey’s sports betting revenue.</p>
<p>But Republican lawmakers argue that the leagues should be given a share of the money, since they are the ones who fought so hard to keep sports betting illegal.</p>
<p>“It’s about time that we give credit where it’s due and allow for an industry that is going to create jobs and tax revenue for our state to grow,” said Assemblyman Ralph Caputo (D-Essex). “Leagues have spent millions fighting this law tooth and nail.”</p>
<p>The Assembly is expected to vote on legislation that would give the leagues a 10 percent share of gross gaming revenue next week. The measure has already passed the Senate.</p>
<h1 id="NJ-Sports-Betting-Bill-On-Life-Support-As-Budget-Negotiations-Drag-On"><a href="#NJ-Sports-Betting-Bill-On-Life-Support-As-Budget-Negotiations-Drag-On" class="headerlink" title="NJ Sports Betting Bill On Life Support As Budget Negotiations Drag On"></a>NJ Sports Betting Bill On Life Support As Budget Negotiations Drag On</h1><h1 id="Trenton-NJ-One-of-the-most-anticipated-bills-in-the-New-Jersey-legislature-the-sports-betting-bill-is-on-life-support-as-budget-negotiations-drag-on"><a href="#Trenton-NJ-One-of-the-most-anticipated-bills-in-the-New-Jersey-legislature-the-sports-betting-bill-is-on-life-support-as-budget-negotiations-drag-on" class="headerlink" title="Trenton, NJ - One of the most anticipated bills in the New Jersey legislature, the sports betting bill, is on life support as budget negotiations drag on."></a>Trenton, NJ - One of the most anticipated bills in the New Jersey legislature, the sports betting bill, is on life support as budget negotiations drag on.</h1><p>Assemblyman Ralph Caputo, a prime sponsor of the bill, said earlier this week that he would not bring it to a vote if there was no consensus among lawmakers about how to fund it.</p>
<p>“If we can’t get everybody on board, I’m not going to put my colleagues through that,” Caputo said. “I’m not going to put the people of New Jersey through that.”</p>
<p>Governor Phil Murphy has already indicated that he would sign the bill into law if it reaches his desk.</p>
<p>The sticking point for lawmakers is how to pay for the regulatory Costs associated with implementation of the bill. The Senate version of the bill includes a tax on sports betting revenue that would go to help fund regulation and other costs associated with sports betting. But the Assembly version of the bill doesn’t include such a tax.</p>
<p>Senate President Steve Sweeney has been adamant about including the tax in order to help pay for costs, but Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin has been resistant. Coughlin says that any new taxes should be considered as part of a broader package of tax hikes and budget cuts.</p>
<p>“We need some additional revenues, and we need to look at all options,” Coughlin said. “But we also have to look at ways we can improve our economy and make it fairer for everyone.”</p>
<p>The horseracing industry is pushing for a share of revenue from sports betting as well, arguing that their casinos and tracks have been hurt by illegal gambling operations. Industry officials say they should be able to recoup some of their losses from those operations.</p>
<p>The standoff over how to pay for sports betting comes as the state is facing a projected $2 billion budget deficit next year. Lawmakers are still trying to agree on a budget for the current fiscal year, which ends on June 30th.</p>
<h1 id="Is-the-Future-of-NJ-Sports-Betting-in-Jeopardy"><a href="#Is-the-Future-of-NJ-Sports-Betting-in-Jeopardy" class="headerlink" title="Is the Future of NJ Sports Betting in Jeopardy?"></a>Is the Future of NJ Sports Betting in Jeopardy?</h1><p>Governor Phil Murphy has been a vocal advocate of legalized sports betting in New Jersey, and he has made it one of his top priorities since taking office this year. However, there are signs that the future of NJ sports betting may be in jeopardy.</p>
<p>Last month, the US Supreme Court agreed to hear a case involving New Jersey and the legality of sports betting. The plaintiffs in the case are the state of New Jersey and four major professional sports leagues (the NFL, NBA, NHL, and MLB). The defendants are the US government and several major professional sports leagues (the NFL, NBA, NHL, and MLB).</p>
<p>The plaintiff’s case is based on the argument that the federal law banning sports betting is unconstitutional. The 10th Amendment guarantees that states have sovereignty rights over all matters not specifically delegated to the federal government. In other words, states can pass laws that are not specifically prohibited by the federal government.</p>
<p>The plaintiff’s argue that the federal law banning sports betting is unconstitutional because it violates state sovereignty rights. They also argue that the law is unconstitutional because it discriminates against states like New Jersey that want to legalize and regulate sports betting.</p>
<p>The defendants argue that the federal law banning sports betting is constitutional for two reasons. First, they argue that Congress has the authority to regulate interstate commerce. Second, they argue that Congress has the authority to protect against corruption in sports.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling on the case by June 2019. If they rule in favor of New Jersey, it would open up the possibility for other states to legalize and regulate sports betting. If they rule in favor of the defendants, it would effectively maintain the status quo and ban legalized sports betting nationwide.</p>
<h1 id="NJ-Legislators-Hope-to-Resolve-Issues-with-Sports-Betting-Bill-This-Week"><a href="#NJ-Legislators-Hope-to-Resolve-Issues-with-Sports-Betting-Bill-This-Week" class="headerlink" title="NJ Legislators Hope to Resolve Issues with Sports Betting Bill This Week"></a>NJ Legislators Hope to Resolve Issues with Sports Betting Bill This Week</h1><p>It has been almost a month since the US Supreme Court overturned the federal ban on sports betting, and lawmakers in New Jersey are still working to resolve some kinks in their proposed bill.</p>
<p>Governor Phil Murphy has been a vocal supporter of legalizing sports betting in NJ, and he is optimistic that a resolution can be reached this week. Key issues that need to be resolved include how much tax will be levied on bets, and how the state will regulate and license sports betting operators.</p>
<p>Lawmakers have been meeting with representatives from the casino industry in order to come up with a workable solution, and there is broad consensus that a tax rate of 10% would be fair. There is also some agreement that licenses should not be granted to casinos that are located within 25 miles of Atlantic City.</p>
<p>Some lawmakers are pushing for a lower tax rate, while others want to see a higher tax to help offset potential losses from legalized sports betting. The governor has said that he is open to compromise, but he wants any bill that is passed to include money for gambling addiction treatment programs.</p>
<p>There is also some concern about the impact of legalized sports betting on the state’s racetracks and horse racing industry. Some lawmakers are calling for a share of the tax revenue generated by sports betting to be earmarked for those businesses.</p>
<p>The goal is to have a bill ready for voting by the end of this week, and it is expected that there will be broad support for it in both chambers of the legislature.</p>
