      		<h1 id="Browns-hoping-to-break-slumping-spell-against-awkward-number-2"><a href="#Browns-hoping-to-break-slumping-spell-against-awkward-number-2" class="headerlink" title="Browns hoping to break slumping spell against awkward number 2"></a>Browns hoping to break slumping spell against awkward number 2</h1><p> coach Hue Jackson is looking for his team to snap a three-game skid when they take on the Detroit Lions this Sunday. The Browns have been outscored 68-16 in those games, including a 31-point drubbing by the Houston Texans last week.</p>
<p>It won’t be easy against the Lions, who come into Week 10 with the second-best scoring offense in the NFL. Detroit is averaging just over 30 points per game and has topped 40 points four times this season.</p>
<p>The Browns will need to get after quarterback Matthew Stafford if they want to have any chance of winning. Stafford has been sacked just 14 times this year, but Cleveland has done a good job of getting after the quarterback in recent weeks. They had five sacks against Houston and eight against Pittsburgh in Week 8.</p>
<p>If the Browns can’t get to Stafford, he could have a big day against their secondary. Rookie cornerback Denzel Ward has played well this year, but he’ll have his hands full against wide receiver Golden Tate. Tate is third in the NFL with 727 receiving yards and has scored four touchdowns.</p>
<p>The Browns will also need to find a way to stop running back Kerryon Johnson. The rookie has been a revelation for Detroit this season, averaging 5.2 yards per carry and scoring four touchdowns.</p>
<p>There are some positive signs for Cleveland despite their losing streak. Quarterback Baker Mayfield has played well in his last two games, completing 67 percent of his passes for 586 yards and four touchdowns. Rookie Nick Chubb has also looked good since taking over as the starter at running back, averaging 5.3 yards per carry and scoring two touchdowns.</p>
<p>The Browns will need all of that firepower if they want to break their streak and notch their first win of the season against Detroit on Sunday.</p>
<h1 id="Browns-avoid-potential-upset-with-strong-performance-against-awkward-number-3"><a href="#Browns-avoid-potential-upset-with-strong-performance-against-awkward-number-3" class="headerlink" title="Browns avoid potential upset with strong performance against awkward number 3"></a>Browns avoid potential upset with strong performance against awkward number 3</h1><p>A 34-20 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals gave the Cleveland Browns some much-needed confidence and erased the bad memories of the week prior. The Browns were facing a difficult task in taking on the third-ranked Cincinnati defense, but they played very well offensively and managed to score 34 points while not allowing any touchdowns. This was an impressive performance against a very tough opponent, and it may have served as a turning point for the season.</p>
<p>The Browns did not take long to get on the scoreboard, as they marched down the field on their opening drive and scored on a touchdown run by Carlos Hyde. This set the tone for the rest of the game, as Cleveland was able to move the ball at will against Cincinnati’s defense. The passing game was particularly effective, with Baker Mayfield throwing for 324 yards and two touchdowns. Jarvis Landry had a huge game, catching 11 passes for 159 yards and a touchdown.</p>
<p>The Browns defense also played well, holding the Bengals to just 20 points. There were some costly penalties called against Cleveland late in the game, but overall this was a solid performance by the defense. The biggest play of the game came when Jabrill Peppers intercepted Andy Dalton and returned it for a touchdown.</p>
<p>This was an important win for the Browns, who now have a record of 2-2-1 heading into their Week 6 matchup against Tampa Bay. If they can build off this performance and continue to play well offensively, they have a chance to make a run at the playoffs.</p>
<h1 id="Offense-comes-up-big-in-victory-over-awkward-number-4"><a href="#Offense-comes-up-big-in-victory-over-awkward-number-4" class="headerlink" title="Offense comes up big in victory over awkward number 4"></a>Offense comes up big in victory over awkward number 4</h1><p> Offense was clicking on all cylinders Friday night as they took down awkward number 4 in what turned out to be a laugher of a game.</p>
<p>The scoring began early, as QB1 hit WR1 on a slant route for a touchdown on the game’s opening drive. The rout continued from there, with the offense scoring at will against an overmatched defense.</p>
<p>RB1 had a great game, piling up yardage on the ground and in the air. He seemed to be in sync with QB1, hitting him with some beautiful passes out of the backfield.</p>
<p>In all, it was a great team victory for the offense. They played like they were possessed, punishing their opponents for daring to cross their path. It was a joy to watch and should serve as a warning to the rest of the league that this offense is serious about making a run at the championship.</p>
<h1 id="Defense-dominates-in-shut-out-win-against-awkward-number-5"><a href="#Defense-dominates-in-shut-out-win-against-awkward-number-5" class="headerlink" title="Defense dominates in shut-out win against awkward number 5"></a>Defense dominates in shut-out win against awkward number 5</h1><p>The Detroit defense was the star of the show on Sunday, shutting out the Atlanta Falcons in a 26-0 victory. The Falcons struggled to move the ball all day, with quarterback Matt Ryan completing just 15 of his 34 passes for 131 yards.</p>
<p>The Detroit defense was able to take advantage of Atlanta’s lack of explosiveness, sacking Ryan four times and forcing two turnovers. The Lions also got a strong performance from their running game, as Kerryon Johnson rushed for 158 yards on 18 carries.</p>
<p>The win moves Detroit to 5-5 on the season, keeping them in playoff contention in a crowded NFC. The next test for the Lions comes in Week 12, when they travel to Chicago to take on the Bears.</p>
