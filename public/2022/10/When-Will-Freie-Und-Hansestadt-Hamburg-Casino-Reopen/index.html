      		<h1 id="When-Will-Freie-Und-Hansestadt-Hamburg-Casino-Reopen"><a href="#When-Will-Freie-Und-Hansestadt-Hamburg-Casino-Reopen" class="headerlink" title="When Will Freie Und Hansestadt Hamburg Casino Reopen?"></a>When Will Freie Und Hansestadt Hamburg Casino Reopen?</h1><p>Freie Und Hansestadt Hamburg Casino, popularly known as Spielbank Hamburg, is one of the largest and most famous casinos in Germany. The casino is situated on the Grosse Elbstrasse in the city of Hamburg, right next to the Reeperbahn. The casino has been closed for renovation since September 1, 2017. The question on everyone’s mind is when will it reopen?</p>
<p>There has been no official word from the casino management about when exactly it will reopen. However, there are speculations that it might open in December 2017. This is based on the fact that a lot of work needs to be done and there is not much time left before December.</p>
<p>The renovation work is being carried out by the company STC-Group which is based in Berlin. The company was awarded the contract to carry out the renovation work by the casino management in November 2016. The contract is said to be worth €10 million.</p>
<p>Some of the work that needs to be done includes: </p>
<ul>
<li>Construction of a new entrance building </li>
<li>Redesign of all public areas </li>
<li>Extension of gaming area </li>
<li>Modernization of technical infrastructure </li>
<li>Creation of additional parking spaces </li>
</ul>
<p>According to STC-Group, the renovation work will take around 14 months to complete. This means that the casino might reopen in January or February 2018.</p>
<h1 id="Will-Freie-Und-Hansestadt-Hamburg-Casino-Reopen-In-Time-For-Christmas"><a href="#Will-Freie-Und-Hansestadt-Hamburg-Casino-Reopen-In-Time-For-Christmas" class="headerlink" title="Will Freie Und Hansestadt Hamburg Casino Reopen In Time For Christmas?"></a>Will Freie Und Hansestadt Hamburg Casino Reopen In Time For Christmas?</h1><p>There has been much speculation in the past few weeks over whether or not Hamburg Casino will reopen its doors in time for Christmas. The casino, which has been closed since June due to redevelopment, is rumored to be opening again on December 22nd.</p>
<p>This would be great news for local gamblers, who have been eagerly awaiting the reopening of their favorite casino. The casino has been completely remodeled, with a new design and new games. There are even rumors that a new VIP lounge will be opening soon.</p>
<p>Of course, nothing has been confirmed yet, and we will have to wait until December 22nd to find out for sure. In the meantime, locals and tourists can enjoy the other casinos in Hamburg, including Spielbank St. Georg, Casino Esplanade, and Spielbank Reeperbahn.</p>
<h1 id="Freie-Und-Hansestadt-Hamburg-Casino-Set-To-Reopen-In-January"><a href="#Freie-Und-Hansestadt-Hamburg-Casino-Set-To-Reopen-In-January" class="headerlink" title="Freie Und Hansestadt Hamburg Casino Set To Reopen In January"></a>Freie Und Hansestadt Hamburg Casino Set To Reopen In January</h1><p>The casino in Hamburg, Germany is scheduled to reopen in January of 2019, following a lengthy closure. The original casino closed its doors in February of 2018 after it was discovered that the owners were laundering money through the operation.</p>
<p>A new company has since taken over the casino, and they have pledged to clean up the business. They have also promised to invest millions of euros into the casino in order to make it a top attraction in Hamburg.</p>
<p>Some of the changes that are planned for the casino include new games, restaurants, and a bar. There will also be a new hotel built on the premises. The goal is to make the casino more attractive for tourists and to create more jobs for locals.</p>
<p>The reopening of the casino is good news for Hamburg, as it will help to boost tourism and create new jobs. It will also help to improve the city’s economy.</p>
<h1 id="Countdown-To-The-Reopening-Of-Freie-Und-Hansestadt-Hamburg-Casino"><a href="#Countdown-To-The-Reopening-Of-Freie-Und-Hansestadt-Hamburg-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Countdown To The Reopening Of Freie Und Hansestadt Hamburg Casino"></a>Countdown To The Reopening Of Freie Und Hansestadt Hamburg Casino</h1><p>The casino in Hamburg, Freie und Hansestadt, is set to reopen in late 2019 after being closed for renovation. The new casino will have twice the number of gaming tables and slot machines as the old one and will also feature a restaurant and bar.</p>
<p>Hamburg is Germany’s second-largest city and is home to about 1.8 million people. The city is located on the Elbe River and is well known for its port, which is one of the busiest in Europe. The city also has a rich cultural history, with many museums, theaters, and music venues.</p>
<p>The casino in Hamburg was first opened in 1963 as the Spielbank Hamburg. It was later expanded and renamed the Casino Esplanade Hamburg. In 2016, the casino closed for renovation and was expected to reopen in 2018. However, due to construction delays, the reopening has been pushed back to late 2019.</p>
<p>The new casino will be housed in a new building that is being constructed next to the old casino. The new building will have four stories and a total of 350 gaming tables and 1,500 slot machines. The old building will be demolished once the new casino opens.</p>
<p>In addition to the gaming tables and slot machines, the new casino will also have a restaurant and bar on its premises. The restaurant will be called “Casino Zwei” and will serve Mediterranean cuisine. The bar will be called “Cocktail Bar” and will serve cocktails and light snacks.</p>
<p>The reopening of the Casino Esplanade Hamburg is sure to be a popular event among gamblers in Hamburg as well as tourists visiting the city. With twice as many gaming tables and slot machines as before, as well as a restaurant and bar on site, the new casino is sure to be a hit among gambling enthusiasts!</p>
<h1 id="Will-The-Delay-In-The-Reopening-Of-Freie-Und-Hansestadt-Hamburg-Casino-Affect-Business"><a href="#Will-The-Delay-In-The-Reopening-Of-Freie-Und-Hansestadt-Hamburg-Casino-Affect-Business" class="headerlink" title="Will The Delay In The Reopening Of Freie Und Hansestadt Hamburg Casino Affect Business?"></a>Will The Delay In The Reopening Of Freie Und Hansestadt Hamburg Casino Affect Business?</h1><p>It was recently announced that the reopening of the Freie Und Hansestadt Hamburg Casino will be delayed until September. This has left many in the business community wondering whether this will adversely affect business in the city.</p>
<p>There is no question that the casino is a major attraction for tourists and locals alike. It is one of the largest and most popular casinos in Europe. The fact that it is now closed for renovations has generated a lot of concern among business owners.</p>
<p>Some people are predicting that there will be a significant loss in revenue for the city as a result of the closure. Others feel that things will not be as bad as expected, since people can still visit other casinos in the area.</p>
<p>In any case, it will be interesting to see how business unfolds over the next few months. There is no doubt that the reopening of the casino will have a major impact on tourism and commerce in Hamburg.</p>
